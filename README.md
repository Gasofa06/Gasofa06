### Hii :)

I'm Roger, I build all types of software programs. 

I created some games for my own in C# and Unity; I learned HTML, CSS and JS for web development; I builded some program in Python as well; I also touched some Solidity for Smart Contracts; and I'm starting to start my Rust path.

Love cryptography and design.

Just to start knowing us, my favorite Pokemon is Rowlet, but i also love Gengar and Dragonit. They are awsemo, aren't they? psyduck, snorut, snorlax, tokegiss, leafon, victini, snom, sobble.
